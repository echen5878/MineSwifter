Hi! Welcome to MineSwifter: The Taylor Swift-themed MineSweeper game. To
compile our game, simply follow these steps:
- After unzipping the folder with the files, change your current working
  to the directory with the files.
- To compile the files and run the game, use:
  --> make compile : first time only to create the .cmo files
  --> make play : to run the game

If you have any issues compiling and running the game, do the following steps:
  --> make clean
  --> _build/sanitize.sh (if the _build directory exists)
  --> make compile
  --> make play

May the odds be ever in your favor and may you become the ultimate MineSwifter
master. :)
